<h3>Soccer Agents based on Reinforcement learing</h3>
<div class="project-meta">Python | <a href="Projects/RL.MOV">Video</a></div>
<ul>
    <li>Guided by the instructor, Prof. Jeremy Curuksu.</li>
    <li>Used Unity's ML-Agents PettingZoo Wrapper to train and compare policies on the SoccerTwos environment (2v2 soccer).</li>
